# Installation

This section contains the following

- [Instructions](#installation-instructions) for installing BehaVerify.
- An [explanation](#explanation-of-installation-instructions) of the instructions.
- A discussion on [using the virtual environment](#using-the-virtual-environment).
- A [test run](#test-run) to confirm that installation worked correctly.


## Installation Instructions


The following commands will download and install BehaVerify. A breakdown of the commands is provided below, in case something goes wrong. While the installation commands are formatted for Linux, we believe that BehaVerify will work on other operating systems.

```
wget https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/theme/download.php?file=nuXmv-2.1.0-linux64.tar.xz -O ./nuXmv_DL.tar.xz
tar -xf ./nuXmv_DL.tar.xz --one-top-level=nuXmv_DL --strip-components 1
mv ./nuXmv_DL/bin/nuXmv ./nuXmv
chmod +x nuXmv
git clone https://github.com/verivital/behaverify
cd behaverify
python3 -m venv ../behaverify_venv
source ../behaverify_venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install .
```

### Explanation of installation

These four commands are used to download [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/), extract the file, retrieve the executable, and ensure it is runnable.
```
wget https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/theme/download.php?file=nuXmv-2.1.0-linux64.tar.xz -O ./nuXmv_DL.tar.xz
tar -xf ./nuXmv_DL.tar.xz --one-top-level=nuXmv_DL --strip-components 1
mv ./nuXmv_DL/bin/nuXmv ./nuXmv
chmod +x nuXmv
```
We provide some additional details about [nuXmv](#nuXmv).

---

These two commands are used to clone the repository and move into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/verivital/behaverify
cd behaverify
```

---

These three commands are used to create a Python virtual environment, activate it, and then install BehaVerify
```
python3 -m venv ../behaverify_venv
source ../behaverify_venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install .
```

---

Assuming all of the commands have been executed, BehaVerify has now been installed within the virtual environment and is ready for use. See [test run](#test-run) to test your installation.

### Using the Virtual Environment

To run BehaVerify, we will need to use the virtual environment we created during the installation process. This can be done in one of two ways.

1. Activate the virtual environment.
2. Explicitly call the virtual environment.

For method 1, run the following
```
source /path/to/behaverify_venv/bin/activate
```
Now, the terminal you are using should have (behaverify\_venv) listed prior to your username. The virtual environment has been activated within this terminal. You can now use BehaVerify within this terminal. Assuming you are in the top level of the repository and followed the installation instructions, this will be
```
source ../behaverify_venv/bin/activate
```

For method 2, you will need to modify each command that follows in the following manner:
```
python3 ...
```
becomes
```
/path/to/behaverify_venv/bin/python3 ...
```

Assuming you are in the top level of the repository and followed the installation instructions, this will be
```
../behaverify_venv/bin/python3 ...
```

### Test Run

Assuming you are in the top level of the BehaVerify repository, please test your installation by running the following command.
```
python3 -m behaverify nuxmv examples/DrunkenDrone/DrunkenDrone.tree ../behaverify_test --generate --invar --ctl --ltl --simulate 10 --nuxmv_path ../nuXmv 
```

Then use
```
cat ../test/nuxmv/DrunkenDrone.smv
```
and
```
cat ../test/nuxmv/DrunkenDrone_output.txt
```
to view the nuXmv model and verification results, respectively.

# Options

The first argument to BehaVerify is the mode. Currently available modes (not case sensitive) are (in alphabetical order)
- [grid](#grid-mode)
- [Haskell](#haskell-mode)
- [LaTeX](#latex-mode)
- [nuXmv](#nuxmv-mode)
- [Python](#python-mode)
- [trace](#trace-mode)

Each of these is explained in a subsection below, and each features an example of how it could be run. Each example assumes you are at the top level of the repository and that the virtual environment is activated. Note that BehaVerify will do its best to not overwrite any existing files.

## Grid Mode
This mode is used to render a trace from a nuXmv or python execution of a grid world. It is still being developed and functionality is currently limited. Right now, it assumes variables are named in a very specific way, and as such only works with very specific examples. This will be improved in the future. Here we provide an example of how to run BehaVerify with grid mode. 

```
python3 -m behaverify nuxmv examples/NetworkExample/using9995.tree ../behaverify_example_grid/ --generate --ctl --nuxmv_path ../nuXmv
python3 -m behaverify grid nuxmv ../behaverify_example/nuxmv/using9995_output.txt ../behaverify_example_grid/ 10 10
```

The first command generates a nuXmv model and tries to verify the CTL specification. Since the specification is false, nuXmv produces a countertrace. This countertrace is then fed into the second command to produce images of the counterexample.

### Grid Mode Options

Below is a list of arguments for running BehaVerify using grid mode. Each argument is formatted using the following syntax.
- *NAME* : TYPE. DATATYPE. EXPLANATION.
where
- NAME is the name of the argument
- TYPE is either REQUIRED or OPTIONAL.
    - REQUIRED means you must include this argument. Do not type the name of this argument. Order is set.
    - OPTIONAL means you may include this argument. To include it, type '--NAME ARG' where NAME is the name of the argument and ARG is the value. If the DATATYPE is FLAG, do not not include ARG.
- DATATYPE is either Int, String, or Flag.

---

- *mode* : REQUIRED. String. This must be 'grid' (case insensitive). If you use something else, you won't be in grid mode.
- *submode* : REQUIRED. String. This may be 'nuXmv' or 'python' (case insensitive). Use this to swap what kind of input is being parsed.
- *trace\_file* : REQUIRED. String (filepath). This must point to file containing a trace. That trace will be parsed and translated into images.
- *location* : REQUIRED. String (filepath). This must point to a location where the output will be written.
- *x\_size* : REQUIRED. Int. The size of the grid (length).
- *y\_size* : REQUIRED. Int. The size of the grid (height).
- *overwrite* : OPTIONAL. Flag. If set, BehaVerify will overwrite existing files.


## Haskell Mode
This mode is used to generate a Haskell implementation of the behavior tree.
```
python3 -m behaverify haskell ./examples/Collatz/collatz.tree ../behaverify_example_haskell/
```

### Haskell Mode Options

Below is a list of arguments for running BehaVerify using Haskell mode. Each argument is formatted using the following syntax.

    - REQUIRED means you must include this argument. Do not type the name of this argument. Order is set.
    - OPTIONAL means you may include this argument. To include it, type '--NAME ARG' where NAME is the name of the argument and ARG is the value. If the DATATYPE is FLAG, do not not include ARG.
- DATATYPE is either Int, String, or Flag.

---

- *mode* : REQUIRED. String. This must be 'haskell' (case insensitive). If you use something else, you won't be in haskell mode.
- *model\_file* : REQUIRED. String (filepath). This must point to file containing a model. Haskell code will be written based on the model.
- *location* : REQUIRED. String (filepath). This must point to a location where the output will be written.

- *max\_iter* : OPTIONAL. Int. The maximum number of iterations to simulate. Default is 100.
- *recursion\_limit* : OPTIONAL. Int. Can be used to increase the Python recursion limit. Particularly large or complex models may require a large recursion stack, mostly for TextX to correctly parse the model file.
- *no\_checks* : OPTIONAL. FLAG. If set, BehaVerify will skip grammar checking. As a result, files will be produced more quickly. Grammar checking is used to provide readable errors that explain why a model does not work. If a model\_file contains no errors, these may be safely ignored. If a model\_file contains errors and this is omitted, BehaVerify may crash in unexpected ways, or the output may not function correctly.
- *overwrite* : OPTIONAL. Flag. If set, BehaVerify will overwrite existing files.

- *recursion\_limit* : OPTIONAL. Int. Can be used to increase the Python recursion limit. Particularly large or complex models may require a large recursion stack, mostly for TextX to correctly parse the model file.
- *overwrite* : OPTIONAL. Flag. If set, BehaVerify will overwrite existing files.
- *on\_sides* : OPTIONAL. Flag. If set, BehaVerify will change the placement of variable information, initial values, and environment updates.
